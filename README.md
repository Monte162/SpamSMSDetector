# Spam SMS Detector

This is an Android app for my data mining project. SMS Spam and Phishing Detector detects if a SMS is a spam message and if an URL is liked to a phishing website.

The application uses two neural networks models to classify the SMS and the URL, both models were created on Tensorflow, the application sends a warning notification to the user when an SMS is spam and informs the user about the phishing site.
