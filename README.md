# Spam SMS Detector

This is an Android app for my data mining project. SMS Spam and Phishing Detector detects if a SMS is a spam message and if an URL is liked to a phishing website.

The application uses two neural networks models to classify the SMS and the URL, both models were created on Tensorflow, the application sends a warning notification to the user when an SMS is spam and informs the user about the phishing site.

The application was published in the Google Play Store by the name [“SMS Spam Detector”](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.personal.frbk1992.spamsmsdetector&hl=en).
